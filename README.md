# The Brain Recording Analysis and Visualization Online (BRAVO) Platform - Server-side Rendering Version

The Brain Recording Analysis and Visualization Online (BRAVO) is a Python-based Web Application designed to process and analyze commercially available third-party neurostimulator JSON data. 

The tool is completely open sourced, with template from Creative Tim's Argon Dashboard HTML template (https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-dashboard) and rewritten by us in Django's template engine language. 

Previously, a demo site is setup for reviewers and potential users to test the platform; however, per request, the demo server is effectively disabled and will not be accessible by the public in the future. The BRAVO Platform is expected to undergo adjustments to remove all references to third-party copyright/trademark terminologies. The University of Florida is solely responsible for the BRAVO Platform. The BRAVO Platform is for research use only. The BRAVO Platform was created and is maintained without any involvement, evaluation, or endorsement by any third party medical device company. 

## Version 2 Migration

Version 2 of the BRAVO Platform (https://github.com/Fixel-Institute/BRAVO) is currently the recommended version to start if you are new to the platform. Changelogs can be found at the new documentation page (https://bravo-documentation.jcagle.solutions/ChangeLogs/v2.0.0).

The primary reason that Version 2 is not being actively maintained from this repository is because we have changed the server organization and utilized a static One-Page approach to the frontend to allow easier manipulation by users. A migration guide is available at (https://bravo-documentation.jcagle.solutions/Tutorials/MigrationGuide) for migrating from BRAVO_SSR to the new BRAVO repository. 

Version 2 also works with Docker for ease of installation for offline single user use.
