# The Brain Recording Analysis and Visualization Online (BRAVO) Platform - Server-side Rendering Version

Percept Analysis Platform is a Python-based Web Application designed to process and analyze Medtronic Percept Neurostimulator data. Currently a demo site is setup at https://bravo.jcagle.solutions/ to demonstrate its capabilitiy. 

The tool is completely open sourced, with template from Creative Tim's Argon Dashboard HTML template (https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-dashboard) and rewritten by us in Django's template engine language. 

Installation Process can be viewed at the Documentation Page (https://bravo.jcagle.solutions/documentation/installation). Linux and Windows are tested. MacOS cannot use the install.sh script and a tutorial is in development.
