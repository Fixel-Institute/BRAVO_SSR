      <p>
        The procedure described here are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with source file directly clone through GitHub. 
        The procedure here are describing for both HTTP deployment (internal use only) and HTTPS deployment (public release). 
        If you intend to deploy this software for public, I highly recommend using Linux deployment procedure for HTTPS. 
        This tutorial will also cover for procedure to setup Amazon Web Service Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) platform to work with Django Project.

  <section class="docs-section" id="section-linux-prereq">
    <h2 class="section-heading">Prerequisite</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1. Python 3.7 or above</b>
    </p> 
    <p>
      Additional required packages will all be installed during the installation script, therefore not listed. 
      It is also noted that the default Python distribution on Ubuntu 18.04 is Python 3.6, therefore not satisfying the requirement. 
      You need to either manually update the Python distribution so that <code>python3 --version</code> is up-to-date or use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, which comes with Python 3.8.
    </p>

    <p>
      All procedure assume that your working directory is the main directory of the cloned Git folder 
      (i.e.: <code>/home/ubuntu/BRAVO_SSR</code>).
    </p> 
    <p>
      In addition, it is recommended to manually create a SECRET_KEY variable for Django. 
      You can either manually edit Line 17 of 
      <a href="https://github.com/Fixel-Institute/BRAVO_SSR/blob/main/install.sh">install.sh</a> 
      to put your own secret key, 
      or use <code>export</code> command in bash command line to create that manually.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="docs-section" id="section-linux-database">
    <h2 class="section-heading">1. SQL Database</h2>

    <p>
      SQL Database will be used to store account information, patient entries, device entries, and various recording information. 
      Due to the data size, neural recordings are not directly stored in database, but instead stored locally in binary format at the DataStorage folder. 
      A data pointer that associate local files with patient recording will be stored in database for ease-of-access. 
    </p>
    <p>
      SQL Database will require manual creation prior to main server installation unless an existing database is used. 
      You can access MySQL Database (the default database used for the installation script, but other database can be used.)
    </p>
    <pre class="rounded" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <code class="bash">
  sudo mysql -u root
  # this would prompt you to enter admin password here for superuser privilege.

  # Following commands are within mysql command-line-interface
  # Create database named "PerceptServer"
  mysql> CREATE DATABASE PerceptServer;

  # Create a user that can access the database called "DjangoUser" with an admin password called "AdminPassword"
  # Change these values to what you see fit.
  mysql> CREATE USER 'DjangoUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'AdminPassword';
  mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON PerceptServer.* TO 'DjangoUser'@'localhost';
  mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

  # exit MySQL Interface 
  mysql> exit
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Once the account is set-up and database is created. You can edit the 
      <a href="https://github.com/Fixel-Institute/BRAVO_SSR/blob/main/mysql.config">mysql.config</a> 
      file to reflect actual accses credential for your database.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="docs-section" id="section-linux-procedure">
    <h2 class="section-heading">2. Installation Procedure</h2>
    <p>
      Change permission to the installation script to "can execute",and run the script as a shell script. 
      The shell script will install other important dependencies first, so admin permission is required.
    </p>

    <pre class="rounded" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <code class="bash">
  sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
  ./install.sh
  # Installation script would prompt you to enter admin password here for superuser privilege.
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      During installation, 4 variables are required for configurations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      First, a default admin username (email) and password is asked. 
      It is not "required" as the system can operate without any admin account.

      But for users who do not want to manually promote a new account as admin, 
      this allow easy creation of one admin account for the platform. 

      If you decide to skip through these configurations, a standard Admin account will still be created, 
      except that the password is going to be cryptic due to random generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the path to the DataStorage folder will be asked. 
      This is defined as an empty directory for storing all Percept data and processed data. 
      It is recommended to use a backup-enabled folder (such as a folder synced with HIPAA Compliant Dropbox or OneDrive server). 
      This directory will be created by the installation script if a non-existing directory is given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, a server IP address is required by the user. 
      It is recommended to put your external static IP here for Django Server setup. 
      If you are going to use localhost only, leave it as <b>localhost</b> will be fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the auto-installation process, bash script will create a Python Virtual Environment called PerceptPlatformEnv 
      and place it in the same root directory as Django project. 
      
      Necessary Python packages (dependencies) will be installed. 
      Then, the script will create a WSGI file (more about it later) called <code>wsgi_production.py</code> in <i>PerceptServer_Pro</i> folder. 
      
      This file will serve as main entry point for Apache Server to run Django file, 
      therefore, it will store all information you configured as environment variables for Python. 
    </p>
    <div class="callout-block callout-block-danger">
      <div class="content">
        <h4 class="callout-title">
          <span class="callout-icon-holder me-1">
            <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
          </span>
          IMPORTANT
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>DO NOT SHARE <code>wsgi_production.py</code>, AS IT CONTAINS YOUR SECRET KEY AS WELL</b>. 
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Afterward, it will also create a production configuration file for Apache 2 Server automatically 
      while disable the default Apache 2 virtual host and enable Percept Analysis Platform in your virtual host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last bit of the installation script will perform clean up, 
      such as creating static folders, giving Apache 2 permissions to your Django folder and your DataStorage folder.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="docs-section" id="section-linux-deploy">
    <h2 class="section-heading">Deployment</h2>
    <p>
      This section primarily focus on deployment of the Percept Analysis Platform on AWS EC2 instance. 
      This procedure, however, will not cover details for best-practice for HIPAA compliance. For details, 
      you may visit AWS's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/">HIPAA Compliance Page</a>.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Deploying Django project in AWS is a common practice and there are many different resources online for this. 
      Majority of the works needed (such as configuration for httpd and virtual hosts) are done in the installation script already, 
      so the procedure here described mainly from a AWS Server setup point-of-view.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon Web Service - Elastic Compute Cloud</h3>
    <p>
      Once you register your AWS Account, you can create your own Amazon EC2 instances. 
      If this is the first time you use AWS, you will be offered free trial using their T2.micro or T3.micro 
      (1 vCPU, 1G RAM) for free for 750 hours (essentially, 24/7 for a month) per month. 
      However, it is recommended not to use those, as the Percept Analysis Platform hungers for computational power, 
      and data above 600 seconds continuous data (such as commonly the Indefinite Streams) will likely lead to CPU lock at 99.9%.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the demo shared by the author, BRAVO Platform is operating on a C6gn.large instance 
      (2 3.60GHz vCPU, 4G RAM), which is sufficient for dozens of users as long as not concurrently processing 
      significantly large files (such as hour-long medication wash-in wash-out recordings). 
      Typical hourly-averaged CPU load is less than 0.05%, with processing of significantly large file (1 hour duration Indefinite Streaming) 
      cost about 5% hourly-averaged CPU load. This instance is more than sufficient for individual clinics, 
      but not for a general public server that support multiple clinics and research institutes. 
      That being said, C6gn.large is chosen as demo because it is sufficient for demo with a significantly 
      lower price than high-end instances ($0.034 per hour). The room for growth is large, given a 16 vCPU version of C5 instance 
      (C5.4xlarge), cost only $0.68 per hour but will be more than sufficient to host a couple institutes. 
      Cheaper variant of computation optimized server is also available through ARM-based processor, 
      which offer 40% better price performance than typical x86 instances. The BRAVO Platform is compatible with both x86 image 
      and ARM-based image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another factor to consider is the hard-drive. 
      Typically, Percept JSON file do not take up much space, but factoring into pre-processed time-frequency data and various cache files, 
      the size storage can be a few fold larger. As a reference, for 850 JSON files totaling with 2.60GB storage takes about 
      7.0GB additional as cache files. This being said, non-research Percept JSON are usually significantly smaller, 
      and Fixel Institute at University of Florida generate about 3.0GB JSON file over the span of one year. 
      Given the simplicity of expanding AWS Storage, it is good to budget around 20G storage first and expand as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, the Amazon Machine Image is recommended with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as it naturally support all requirement 
      for the Percept Analysis Platform. Installation on a brand new image is simply running the installation script.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon Web Service - Security Group</h3>
    <p>
      Creating your own AWS Instance, clone the project, and run the installation script will automatically setup everything 
      for the Percept Analysis Platform to work. This includes public access through HTTP in debug mode. 
      By default, <code>DEBUG=True</code>, which will allow display of error messages that give you an idea about 
      why some requests do not go through if a 404/500 Network Error occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the server is ready, you need to configure AWS EC2 instance's Security Group to allow HTTP access at Port 80. 
      To do so, navigate to <code>EC2 -> Instances -> %YOUR_INSTANCE_ID% -> Security -> %YOUR_SECURITY_GROUPS_ID%</code>. 
      By default, only Port 22 is enabled (for SSH Access). You can <b>Edit Inbound Rules</b> to include 2 additional protocols:
    </p>
    <pre class="rounded" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <code class="bash">
  Protocol 1:
  Type: HTTP
  Port: 80
  Source: Anywhere-IPv4
  
  Protocol 2:
  Type: HTTP
  Port: 80
  Source: Anywhere-IPv6
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      These rules will grant you access to view your platform in HTTP with debug. 
      Now you can simply navigate to your browser and see the website from <b>http://%YOUR_INSTANCE_EXTERNAL_IPv4%/</b>. 
      If you see Django error page about that IP address is not allowed, it is most likely you entered a wrong IP address 
      during installation or somehow your IP address changed (Dynamic IPs). 
      Look at <b>PerceptServer_Pro/wsgi_production.py</b> and find <code>os.environ["SERVER_ADDRESS"]</code> and change the value to your new IP address.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon Web Service - Elastic IPs</h3>
    <p>
      However, if you do not allocate a static IP through Elastic IPs, your external IP address could change with time 
      (especially when restarting instances). Allocation is easy, the best option is to just allocate one from Amazon's Pool IPv4. 
      Then associate that IP with your running EC2 instance. The association is usually fast and will be ready within minutes. 
      After new IP is selected, go back to the previous section and follow the procedure to change your SERVER_ADDRESS to the new IP address.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon Web Service - Application Load Balancer and Route 53</h3>
    <p>
      However, that is only reasonable within the institute or during development. 
      The best practice is to configure DEBUG=False with a public SSL-certificate for HTTPS access and remove all debug pages. 
      Register a AWS Application Load Balancer from EC2 Dashboard and add 2 listeners:
    </p>
    <pre class="rounded" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <code class="bash">
  Protocol: HTTP
  Port: 80
  Add Action: Forward to -> Target Group (Target Group is your Django Security Group)
  
  Protocol: HTTPS
  Port: 443
  Add Action: Forward to -> Target Group (Target Group is your Django Security Group)
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      Noted that if you configure HTTPS, AWS will require you to provide a SSL-certificate, 
      which you can generate using AWS's Free Public-SSL service, given that you have your domains ready. 
      You can go to AWS Certificate Manager -> Request a public certificate. Though validations varies, you usually use 
      DNS validation if you registered your domain through AWS Route 53.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once certificate is obtained and HTTPS Load Balancer is configured, you can now create a hosted zone for your domain 
      (even if you do not have the domain registered through AWS, you can still use the Hosted Zone service). 
      Create a Type A routing from your domain record to the load balancer you created. Once everything is setup in Route 53 
      and Load Balancer, you can now modify the <b>PerceptAnalysis/settings.py</b> file to include your new domain in Line 43: 
      <code>ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost", os.environ.get('SERVER_ADDRESS'), "%YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME%"]</code>, 
      and change <code>DEBUG=True</code> to <code>DEBUG=False</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that everything is configured, you will be able to access the website you setup through 
      <b>https://%YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME%/</b>. All network traffics will be routing through HTTPS at Port 443 from now on.
    </p>

        The procedure described here are tested on Windows 10 Home OS (Build 19043.1348) with source file directly 
        clone through GitHub Desktop. The procedure here are describing solely for HTTP deployment (internal use only). 
        
        If you intend to deploy this software for public, I highly recommend using Linux deployment procedure for HTTPS. 
        Tutorials are available for Amazon Web Service Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) platform.

        Installation of Percept Analysis Platform on Windows is definitely more complicated than a full-controlled Linux Installation script. 
        Much of the contents require manual editing in different locations that could give rise to errors. 
        However, Windows remains to be the most common operating system right now and it is likely that the research institutes or 
        clinics do not have high-computation Linux Computer. In those scenario, we would like to ensure that Windows User 
        have access to our platform as well, so we develop this installation tutorial for Django Project with Windows Apache.

  <section class="docs-section" id="section-windows-procedure">
    <h2 class="section-heading">2. Installation Procedure</h2>
    <p>
      All procedure assume that your working direcctory is the main directory of the cloned Git folder 
      (i.e.: <code>C:\Users\Username\Documents\GitHub\PerceptAnalysis_Server</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>It is highly recommended to have Python installed with administrator privilege. </b>
      This allow Apache Server service to be run as Local System Account, instead of being tied to a specific account. 
      For use with specific account, additional steps are required (see below).
    </p>

    <h3>a. Python Environment Setup</h3>
    <p>
      Open Command Prompt as administrator (or not, if you are using it with specific account), 
      verify with <code>python --version</code> that the installed Python Version is above 3.70 
      (minimum version required for DateTime conversion for Percept JSON structure). 
      Install Python Virtual Environment tool with PyPI. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Install virtual environment with virtualenv. 
      The following steps will install PerceptPlatformEnv folder in the Django root folder along with other server-side codes. 
      Doing this instead of installing Python Environment at a shared location allow easier navigations and configurations for Apache. 
      Once install, verified that you see (<b>PerceptPlatformEnv</b>) prepend to your command line prompt.
      Then you can install dependencies package in the new environment
    </p>

    <pre class="rounded" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <code class="bash">
  # In Anaconda Prompt, or Command Prompt, depends on how your Python is installed. 
  pip install virtualenv
  virtualenv PerceptPlatformEnv
  PerceptPlatformEnv\Scripts\activate.bat
  pip install django djangorestframework numpy scipy pandas spectrum mysqlclient requests websocket-client joblib
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>b. Django Settinngs and WSGI Settings</h3>
    <p>
      Navigate to <b>PerceptPlatform/wsgi_windows.py</b> file. 
      Temporary environment variables are setup already for placeholder. 
      The most important edit is to ensure <b><i>SERVER_DIRECTORY</i></b> is correctly labeled, 
      it should be the path to your Django root folder (i.e.: <code>C:\Users\Username\Documents\GitHub\PerceptAnalysis_Server</code>). 
      Leave <i>PERCEPT_DIR</i> and <i>STATIC_ROOT</i> unmodified, but change <b><i>SERVER_ADDRESS</i></b> to your computer's 
      Private IPv4 address (internal network). 
      Change <i>DATASERVER_PATH</i> to a backup-enabled folder (such as a folder synced with HIPAA Compliant Dropbox or OneDrive server).
    </p>

    <div class="callout-block callout-block-danger">
      <div class="content">
        <h4 class="callout-title">
          <span class="callout-icon-holder me-1">
            <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
          </span>
          IMPORTANT
        </h4>
        <p>
          If Apache Server is setup with Local System Account, it cannot access Network Resources. 
          If you decide to put DATASERVER_PATH as one of the Windows Share Folders, 
          create a dedicated account for your domain and follow the <a href="#section-windows-deploy">procedure</a> below to configure Apache Server service account. 
          However, this procedure is not tested by the author and is subjected to modifications.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Afterward, ensure all neccessary files are setup by running the following Django Comamnds:
    </p>
    <pre class="rounded" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <code class="bash">
  # In Anaconda Prompt, or Command Prompt, using "PerceptPlatformEnv" virtual environment
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py collectstatic
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      After that is done, try to start the Percept Analysis Platform on localhost to confirm all Python packages are installed without errors. 
      Make sure <b>PerceptServer_Pro/settings.py</b> file has <code>DEBUG = True</code> (line 33) configured, otherwise the website will not function until 
      Apache Server is setup to serve static files. You can view the platform on <a href="http://localhost:8000/">localhost:8000</a>.
    </p>
    <pre class="rounded" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <code class="bash">
  # In Anaconda Prompt, or Command Prompt, using "PerceptPlatformEnv" virtual environment
  python manage.py runserver
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>c. Apache Server Setup</h3>
    <p>
      The Apache Server used in this example is the XAMPP (Apache Friend) for easy-to-use GUI. 
      Many different network development distributions are available in the same package, but only Apache is needed in this case. 
      The default installation folder is usually <code>C:/xampp</code>, which is how we will refer to in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once XAMPP installation is done, confirm Apache Server is in <code>C:/xampp/apache</code> folder. 
      Now, we need to create an environment variable that point to the Apache Server for Python modules. 
      Create an environment variable called  <code>MOD_WSGI_APACHE_ROOTDIR</code> and set its value to <code>C:/xampp/apache</code>. 
      <b>[System Properties -> Environment Variables... -> System Variables -> New...]</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Return back to the command prompt, now install mod_wsgi package for Python. 
      You may need to restart command prompt so the new Environment Variable is registered, otherwise mod_wsgi building will have errors.
    </p>
    <pre class="rounded" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <code class="bash">
  # In Anaconda Prompt, or Command Prompt, using "PerceptPlatformEnv" virtual environment
  pip install mod_wsgi
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      Once mod_wsgi is installed, verify the module configuration with command <code>mod_wsgi-express module-config</code> 
      and copy its content (except the <b>WSGIPythonHome</b>) to <code>C:/xampp/apache/conf/httpd.conf</code>. It should look like something below.
    </p>
    <pre class="rounded" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <code class="bash">
  # In Anaconda Prompt, or Command Prompt, using "PerceptPlatformEnv" virtual environment
  mod_wsgi-express module-config

  # Expect the following output:
  LoadFile "C:/Program Files/Python310/python310.dll"
  LoadModule wsgi_module "C:/Users/Username/Documents/GitHub/BRAVO_SSR/PerceptPlatformEnv/lib/site-packages/mod_wsgi/server/mod_wsgi.cp310-win_amd64.pyd"
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      Now, configure the <b>httpd-vhosts.conf</b> file in the cloned directory. The following information are needed:
    </p>

    <h6> 1. ServerName </h6>
    <p>
      Change <i>localhost</i> to the IP address you set for <i>SERVER_ADDRESS</i> in <b>PerceptAnalysis/wsgi_windows.py</b> file.
    </p>

    <h6> 2. Directory Path </h6>
    <p>
      Essentially, all occurrence of <code>C:/Users/Username/Documents/GitHub/PerceptAnalysis_Server</code> in the template file 
      should be changed to where you store your cloned Django root folder. 
      This occur multiple times in the file, make sure they are all changed (Line 3, Line 5, Line 6, Line 10, Line 17) 
      but make sure their suffix folders or filename are untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that all contents are changed, copy <b>httpd-vhosts.conf</b> file to <code>C:/xampp/apache/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</code>
      and replace the original file (the original file has no actual content, 
      so you can simply copy the text content of your modified file and append at the end of the original file as well).

      Open XAMPP as Administrator, this will allow you to install Apache as a Windows Service. 
      If you do not wish to have Apache as Windows Service, you can open it as local user. 
      If you are Admin, you can see a red cross mark to the left of Apache module, clicking it will install Apache Windows Service. 
      If not, clicking Start to the right of Apache will start Apache in Port 80 (HTTP) and Port 443 (HTTPS) with your application configurations. 
      You can now view your data through <code>http://%SERVER_ADDRESS%/</code> (registration may be required or you can use the admin account you set up during installation).
    </p> 
    <p>
      For Python installed on individual user, 
      Apache will most likely have no permission to view your Python executable when used as Local System Account, 
      and therefore lead to error in deployment as Windows Service (most typically, <code>Fatal Python error: initfsencoding: 
      unable to load the file system codec ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'</code>). 
      For this situation, open Windows Service tab and Right click on Apache service <code>ApacheX.Y</code> (sub X and Y to your Apache version) 
      and view <code>Properties</code>. Go to <code>Log On</code> tab and specify a specific account using <code>This Account</code> option instead of <code>Local System Account</code>. 
      This is also the same place where you can input a domain account to access Network Resources.
